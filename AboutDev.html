          In this day and age, we live in a time and day where we have integrated Technology with our ways of living. We
          have improved from computers to portable supercomputers, such as smartphones. We have developed A.I.; the
          closest thing to an A.I. before its development was Digital Assistance. Digital Assistance Technology has been
          out since the day Siri was introduced and put out to the public by Apple. So, as of today, let us see how
          often we use these Digital assistants.
