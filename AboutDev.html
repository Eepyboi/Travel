          Hi, well, I am Kevin Lam, the Web Developer. I am an ISTF-J on the Myers-Briggs personality. I am a
          23-year-old male who is currently in college. I am also a major Volleyball Maniac and a huge anime fan, and I
          wish to go to Japan one day.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <p>
            Now, one might ask: "Why would anyone want to visit Japan?" Well, great question; I, for one, am a Weeb, as
            you can tell from how this page is designed regarding the charming color theme, and some of the pictures
            are anime-related. Most of my reasons would be on my personal bucket list. I have a lot of things I want to
            do in Japan, and I would love to go there. Other than that, I want to experience the culture there. Hence,
            the reason I included a Bucket List Page for anyone who might be interested in going to Japan can cross off
            or add to their own Bucket List if any of those activities or items are what they would like to do that
            match with some of the things I would personally like to do.
