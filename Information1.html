      <td class="question">Does Japan still use paper money?</td>
      <td> Yes, They still do. Due to Covid, Places have now offered to accept payments by card. You can also use the
        transit card or Apple Wallet to pay. The few places that will still require you to use Paper Cash are for Street
        Festivals and events.</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question">If I am sick or just have allergies while in Japan?</td>
      <td> Well, If you are sick, wear a mask. If you have allergies and need to blow your nose, you may discreetly wipe
        your nose with a tissue. You still don't want to face anyone while dabbing your nose, and you don't want to make
        any sound. Remember to use a tissue, not a handkerchief, and excuse yourself if a discreet wipe isn't
        sufficient. Blowing your nose is found to be rude and disgusting.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="question"> What if I don't know any Japanese? </td>
      <td> Some tourist places and locations should have some English menus and subtexts for people to use. However,
        ideally, from the perspective of Japan, it would be mindful to learn Japanese for the sake of their point of
        view in their culture; it would be showing them respect that you are attempting to become immersed into the
        culture. Also, anime fans are advised not to try to use that way of speaking as it is a mockery. The last option
        is to bring an interpreter if you need more time to learn ...</td>

    <tr>
      <td class="question"> Biggest Tip to Give </td>
      <td> Whatever you do,<strong> do not do what Logan Paul did if you know you know</strong>, and don't try to be a crazy influencer
        like you are famous; just be yourself and humbled and enjoy the experience there. Think of it like you are on a
        school trip.</td>
